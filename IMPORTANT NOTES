1) Project must be named:
Lab11
2) ALWAYS DOWNLOAD NEW VERSION BEFORE EDITING.
3) You should ONLY upload/replace the src folder. Stay within your own functions, and make your own main files. We will combine them when we can.
4) Label the functions you're working on and what they're for. Ex:
  void init_spi1_slow() //ZP SPI SD card reader
  
  
  EDIT: I gotten git working. Use terminal and standard git commands. Make sure you're pulling and committing to master branch.
